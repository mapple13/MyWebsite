Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics](https://aede.osu.edu/) at The Ohio State University. 

My research lies at the intersection of **international trade**, **environmental** and **agricultural economics**. I am interested in studying trade and environmental policies to help mitigate the impact of climate change.
<!-- I am largely interested topics related to answering the following question: How can we design trade and environmental policies to mitigate the impact of climate change?  -->

How does **climate change** affect the **global crop production** and **structural transformation** of the labor market? My [**job market paper**](/uploads/JMP_HyeseonShin.pdf) analyzes the impact of climate change on agricultural production and labor market using a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model, incorporating optimal crop choice, international trade, and forward-looking labor mobility. 

What would the **global carbon price** and regional **social cost of carbon** be under a **global emissions trading system (ETS)**? My other paper addresses this question using a dynamic multi-region integrated assessment model (IAM) with the global ETS under noncooperation.

**I am on 2024-2025 job market.** 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
