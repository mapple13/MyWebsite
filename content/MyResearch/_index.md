<!-- <small>Climate change affects agricultural production through land productivity and multicropping capacities. Given agriculture’s substantial contribution to both income and employment in developing economies, evolving agro-climatic conditions can reshape labor reallocation and agricultural production. I develop a dynamic spatial general equilibrium model incorporating farmers’ optimal crop choices, international trade, and forward-looking migration. Under RCP 8.5, global welfare effects on agricultural workers are modest but vary significantly across countries. Results highlight that the general equilibrium effects of labor mobility are nontrivial, and domestic structural transformation can play a crucial role in mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change. </small>  -->

{{< detail-tag "Abstract" >}}
We develop a dynamic multi-region climate–economy model with emissions trading and solve for the dynamic Nash equilibrium under noncooperation, where each region follows Paris Agreement–based emissions caps. The permit price reaches $923 per ton of carbon by 2050, and global temperature rises to 1.7°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. The regional social cost of carbon equals the difference between regional marginal abatement cost and the permit price, highlighting complementarity between carbon taxes and trading. We find substantial heterogeneity in regional social costs of carbon, show that lax caps can raise emissions, and demonstrate strong free-rider incentives under partial participation.

## Selected Work in Progress

<hr>

**Trade Policy, Crop Choice, and Water Stress: Evidence from Mexican Agriculture**. (with Saera Oh)

<span style="font-size: smaller;">
{{< detail-tag "Abstract" >}}
International trade can influence the crop choices of local farmers, with important implications for water use, as some crops are significantly more water-intensive than others. This study investigates how trade policy shapes crop selection in Mexican agriculture and evaluates its impacts on local water resources.

<span style="font-size: smaller;">
{{< detail-tag "Abstract" >}}
In this paper, the effect of non-tariff measures (NTMs) on upgrading of food product quality is analyzed. Based on a multi-sector Schumpeterian model, and given threat of entry, compliance costs, and monopoly profits, NTMs are predicted to have heterogeneous effects on quality upgrading. Using disaggregated data for 14 European Union (EU) countries across 18 food industries for the period 2008-2019, NTM enforcement is found to deter quality upgrading for products distant from the quality frontier due to compliance costs. Conversely, NTM enforcement stimulates quality upgrading for products close to the quality frontier, given an increased probability of capturing monopoly profits.
